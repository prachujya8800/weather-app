# 🌦 Weather Forecast Application  
**Internship Project – Python Programming @ Oasis Infobyte**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my **Python Programming Internship at :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**.  
The aim of the project is to design and develop a **GUI-based Weather Forecast Application** using Python that provides real-time weather information through a simple and user-friendly interface.

The application fetches live weather data from the **OpenWeather API** and displays important weather details such as temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, and weather icons based on the user’s input location.
